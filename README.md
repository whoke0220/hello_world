# hello_world
First repo. Learning Git and GitHub.

I work for Columbia Community Chruch (yes! a church that hired a programmer!). I am interested in almost all things programming, though my biggest downfall is front-end user design. I can code in R, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript and some in PHP.

I amcurrently learning Python and Rust and version control using git and GitHub.
